## Overview

Recreate a centralised card layout containing a QR Code with a title and paragraph text below, following a preset design as accurately as possible. The layout is not mobile responsive and will look the same on mobile and desktop devices.

## My process

I started by creating the grey background for the body element and then adding the div for the white card (.qr-code) which was positioned using flexbox.
I next added the img, h1 and p information and adjusted the css to create a column to change the flow.
The font was changed by linking to GoogleFonts and the relevant weights were selected for h1 and p in the css file.
The subtle box shadow was added at the end, I almost missed it!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Further revision/work is required on flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadows](https://www.xul.fr/en/css/box-shadow.php) - This helped me with the subtle box shadow around the white box, ensuring it works in all browsers.
